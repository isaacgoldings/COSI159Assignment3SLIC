This project includes two implementations of the SLIC superpixel algorithm from the paper "SLIC superpixels" by Achanta et al. the first is my 
implementation, and the second is the skimage package implementation for comparison.

To run my implementation, replace the file name on line 143 with the name of the image you want to process. 
Then use "python SLIC.py" to run the code.

To run the skimage implementation, use the command "python skimage_implementation.py -i campus-spring.jpg" 
and replace campus-spring.jpg with your desired image, if you want to calculate more or less segments, modify
the n_segments variable on line 20.
